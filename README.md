# JSL03 Project Brief: Console-Based Task Manager

## Important Prerequisite

1. Before I started with this challenge, I had to make sure that my JSL02 was on point since it is a built on project, just adding more javascript arrays to the code. 
2. I forked the repository from Github.

## Overview

This project involves creating a **simple task management system** where users can add **up to three new tasks** to an existing task array. Tasks are **stored as objects in an array**, each with a **unique incremental ID**. Users will enter task details via prompts, and the system will allow filtering to view only completed tasks. The project focuses on **array manipulation, user interaction via prompts and alerts, and console logging for task management**.


## How I tackled the project

- Added an HTML file and copied the code from JSL01.
- Added styling to the structure using code from JSL01.
- Stored tasks as objects inside an array for structured data management.
- Added an ID on every task.
- Added prompts for users (tittle, description, status).
- Added and alert message for users when they reach the task limit with the message:
  _"There are enough tasks on your board, please check them in the console."_
  Implemented a filter function to filter the completed tasks `"done"`.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## The Outcome

A **structured and limited task management system** that enables users to add, review, and filter tasks efficiently while ensuring **clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.**

**Console Log of all and completed tasks**
